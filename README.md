# Frontend Mentor - Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page Solution

This is my solution to the **Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page** challenge on Frontend Mentor. This project focuses on building a fully responsive landing page with a dark theme, feature grid, testimonials, and a call-to-action form, following modern frontend best practices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The challenge was a great opportunity to practice semantic HTML, responsive layouts with Flexbox, CSS custom properties, and real-time form validation with vanilla JavaScript.

This project is a responsive landing page for Fylo, designed with a dark theme and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The layout adapts seamlessly across screen sizes, providing a clean and engaging user experience.

The page includes a hero section, features grid, productivity section, testimonials, email sign-up form with validation, and a detailed footer with navigation and social links. The goal was to closely replicate the provided design while keeping the code clean, semantic, and maintainable.

## My process
- Structured the page using **semantic HTML5** elements such as `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `form`, and `footer`.
- Followed a **mobile-first approach**, progressively enhancing the layout with media queries.
- Built the layout using **Flexbox** for alignment and component distribution.
- Used **CSS custom properties (variables)** to manage colors and maintain a consistent dark theme.
- Applied the **BEM naming convention** to keep the CSS modular and easy to maintain.
- Styled interactive elements with hover and focus states to improve usability and accessibility.
- Implemented **real-time email validation** using vanilla JavaScript and regular expressions.
- Controlled UI states by toggling CSS classes from JavaScript.
- Ensured a clean separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
